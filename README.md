# 📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This beginner-friendly quant research project aims to predict the closing stock price of a company using Python, financial time series data, and basic machine learning techniques.

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Collect historical stock data using the `yfinance` API
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering
- Train and evaluate a machine learning model (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Visualize the predictions vs actual prices
- Document the workflow for future quant research projects

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
- yfinance (for stock data)
- scikit-learn (for ML models)
- Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

## 📊 Features Used
- Daily open, close, high, low, and volume
- 5-day and 10-day moving averages
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Daily returns and lagged features

## 📁 Folder Guide
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis and modeling
- `data/`: Raw or cleaned stock price data (optional if using API live)
- `images/`: Generated charts and graphs
- `README.md`: Project overview and guide

## 🧪 How to Run
1. Clone this repo  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stock-price-prediction-project.git
   cd stock-price-prediction-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies  
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the notebook  
   ```
   jupyter notebook notebooks/stock_prediction.ipynb
   ```

## ✅ What I Learned
- Basics of quant-style stock modeling
- How to clean and visualize time series data
- ML model training and error analysis
- How to share work in a professional GitHub portfolio

## 📚 Future Improvements
- Use deep learning models (LSTM, GRU)
- Integrate live dashboards (e.g., Streamlit)
- Expand to multi-stock portfolio modeling
